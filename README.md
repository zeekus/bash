This is my bash stuff.

Most of it is just for fun.
There are some tools for work.

.bashrc_functions  | tool: to exend bash at work by adding functions to .bash_rc
espeak_alarm.sh    | play tool: an alarm program to keep me productive

ksar_sar.sh        | tool : bare bones tool to convert 31 sar files in a format ksar will process
